# project_sweetBliss
Developed a fully functional e-commerce website that allows users to register, log in, and access a personalized landing page. From there, users can browse products, add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
Utilized front-end technologies including HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript, with data persistence handled through the browser's local storage.
